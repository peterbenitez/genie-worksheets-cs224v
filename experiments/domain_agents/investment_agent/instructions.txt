Fidelity Funds:
- Each row represents a unique Fidelity mutual fund, identified by columns like `id`, `symbol`, and `name`.
- Identifier columns (`id`, `symbol`, `name`, `summary`) uniquely label the fund and provide a short marketing description.
- Date, asset, and update columns (`inceptionDate`, `updated`, `assets`) indicate the fund's launch date (ISO-8601 string), most recent data refresh, and total net assets in US dollars.
- Address columns (`address_line1`, `address_line2`, `address_line3`) store the fund company's mailing address; use the additional lines as needed.
- Expense column (`expenseRatio`) is the annual operating expense ratio expressed as a decimal fraction (e.g., `0.0075` = 0.75 % per year).
- Pricing columns (`price_nav`, `price_fiftyTwoWeek_low`, `price_fiftyTwoWeek_high`, `price_fiftyTwoWeek_changePct`, `price_currency`) give current net asset value, 52-week low/high NAV, percentage change between those extremes, and the pricing currency.
- Yield columns (`yields_distribution`, `yields_dividendRate`) report distribution yield and trailing 12-month dividend rate, both expressed in percent per year.
- Trailing-period return columns (`returns_oneYear`, `returns_threeYear`, `returns_fiveYear`, `returns_tenYear`) are annualized total returns for the specified past periods, expressed in percent.
- Calendar-year return columns (`returns_calendar_2015` ... `returns_calendar_2024`) show the fund's total return for each calendar year, in percent; positive values mean gain, negative values mean loss.
- Rating columns (`ratings_morningstarOverall`, `ratings_morningstarRisk`, `ratings_beta3Year`) contain Morningstar's overall star rating (1â€“5 scale), risk rating (numeric scale), and three-year beta relative to the category benchmark.
- Unless otherwise noted, percentage figures are stored as plain numbers where `12.5` represents 12.5 % (except `expenseRatio`, which is stored as a fraction). 

Fidelity Bonds
- Each row represents a unique fixed income security (bond) available for new issue purchase through Fidelity.
- Description column contains the name of the bond.
- Coupon and payment columns (`coupon_rate`, `payment_frequency`) specify the annual interest rate (e.g., "4.000" = 4.00%) and how often interest is paid (e.g., "SEMI-ANNUAL", "ANNUALLY", "MONTHLY", "QUARTERLY").
- Maturity column (`maturity_date`) indicates when the bond principal is due to be repaid, typically in MM/DD/YYYY format.
- Rating columns (`moody_rating`, `sp_rating`) contain credit ratings from Moody's and Standard & Poor's respectively; "--" or "NR" indicates no rating available.
- Pricing columns (`price`, `yield_to_maturity`) show the bond's current offering price (as percentage of par value, where "100.000" = par) and yield to maturity percentage.
- Callable column (`callable`) indicates whether the issuer can redeem the bond before maturity ("Yes" or "No").
- Order period column (`order_period`) specifies the timeframe when orders can be placed, such as "OPEN ORDER PERIOD" or specific deadline dates and times.
- Settlement date column (`settlement_date`) shows when the transaction will settle and payment is due, in MM/DD/YYYY format.
- Classification column (`classification`) contains abbreviated codes indicating bond characteristics (e.g., "SFP" = Suitable for Portfolios, "TE" = Tax Exempt, "GO" = General Obligation, "FDIC" = FDIC insured, "SO" = Survivor Option).
- Price values above 100 indicate the bond trades at a premium; below 100 indicates a discount to par value.
- All percentage rates and yields are expressed as decimal numbers where "4.000" represents 4.000%.

Whenever giving information about the funds, always return all the columns unless specified.
