Event-driven funds that bet on distressed assets during market dislocations occasionally posted triple-digit returns as well.

          "hallucinated_response": "To attempt to double your money in two years with NVIDIA (NVDA) using leverage, you could consider a combination of margin investing and options strategies. Here\u2019s a step-by-step outline: 1) Margin Investing: Open a margin account with your broker, which typically allows you to borrow up to 50% of your investment amount. With $100,000, you could control up to $200,000 worth of NVDA stock. If NVDA rises by 50% over two years, your $200,000 position would be worth $300,000. After repaying the $100,000 margin loan (plus interest), you\u2019d have $200,000\u2014doubling your original investment. However, if NVDA falls by 33%, your equity would be wiped out. 2) Options Strategies: You could buy long-dated call options (LEAPS) on NVDA, which give you leveraged exposure to price increases. For example, buying $100,000 worth of deep-in-the-money LEAPS could provide exposure equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars of NVDA stock. If NVDA doubles, the options could more than double in value, but if NVDA stagnates or falls, you could lose your entire investment. 3) Combining Margin and Options: Some aggressive investors use both margin and options, but this greatly increases risk. Risks: Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. If NVDA declines, you could lose more than your initial investment with margin, or your entire investment with options. Margin calls may force you to sell at a loss. Options can expire worthless. Volatility can work against you. In summary, while doubling your money in two years is possible with leverage if NVDA performs exceptionally well, the risks are extremely high, and you could lose all or more of your investment. Consult a financial advisor before proceeding with leveraged strategies.",
