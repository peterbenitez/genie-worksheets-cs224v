We have a list of examples that you can use to get started with Genie Worksheets.

- [Restaurant Reservation](restaurant_reservation.md): Making a restaurant reservation requires finding a suitable restaurant and providing booking information to complete a transaction. We use the real-life dataset containing restaurants from Yelp.com.
- [Ticket Submission](ticket_submission.md): University portal contains various tasks categorized under different sections and subsections, posing a navigational challenge for students seeking to locate the appropriate link. Additionally, they often contain a vast corpus of free-text data, which students must peruse before submitting a ticket. We evaluate agents' capability to handle nested webpages with predicates and subsequent actions.
- [Course Enrollment](course_enrollment.md): Combines hybrid data sources to search for course details and fill out complicated nested forms. The assistants allow students to ask questions about course requirements, student reviews, and ratings while filling out their enrollment forms. We collect a real-life dataset containing courses from the Computer Science program, with 4 tables (courses, offerings, ratings, and programs).
